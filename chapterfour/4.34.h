/*		Program: Factorial
		The factorial of a nonnegative integer n is written n! (pronounced “n factorial”) and is defined as follows:
					n! = n · (n – 1) · (n – 2) · … · 1 (for values of n greater than 1)
						and
					n! = 1 (for n = 0 or n = 1).
		For example, 5! = 5 · 4 · 3 · 2 · 1, which is 120. Use while statements in each of the following:
					a) Write a program that reads a nonnegative integer and computes and prints its factorial.
