/*	Program: Find the Largest
	The process of finding the largest number (i.e., the maximum of a group of numbers) is used frequently in computer applications. For example, a program that
	determines the winner of a sales contest inputs the number of units sold by each salesperson. The salesperson who sells the most units wins the contest.
	Write a C++ program that uses a while statement to determine and print the largest number of 10 numbers input by the user. Your program should use
	three variables, as follows:
	
	counter: A counter to count to 10 (i.e., to keep track of how many numbers have been input and to determine when all 10 numbers have been processed).
	number: The current number input to the program.
	largest: The largest number found so far.
