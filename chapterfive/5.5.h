/*	Program: (Summing Integers) 
	Write a program that uses a for statement to sum a sequence of integers. Assume that the first integer read specifies the number of values remaining to be
	entered. Your program should read only one value per input statement. A typical input sequence might be 
								5 100 200 300 400 500
	where the 5 indicates that the subsequent 5 values are to be summed.
