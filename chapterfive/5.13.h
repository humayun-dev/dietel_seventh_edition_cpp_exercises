/*		Program: (Bar Chart) 
		One interesting application of computers is drawing graphs and bar charts. Write a program that reads five numbers (each between 1 and 30). 
		Assume that the user enters only valid values. For each number that is read, your program should print a line containing that number of adjacent asterisks.
		For example, if your program reads the number 7, it should print *******.
